## Salmon & Seabass Dataset

Dataset for the salmon/sea bass example from the book Pattern Classification 3nd ed. by Richard O. Duda, Peter E. Hart.

I didn't find a source for the original data set so I reconstructed it from the scatter plot in the book on page 5, by scanning the picture
and using openCV to get the coordinates of the dots, respectively the x-vectors for both classes.
